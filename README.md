Project Definition:
In a faraway democracy, SPLand, there is a political crisis, they can't form a government in
years. The reason is complex promises about whether to cooperate with other parties.
We need you to help the politicians find a coalition!
After 5 elections, the SPLand president decided to change the method of forming a coalition by
letting multiple "agents" from different parties try their best to create a 61 coalition as fast as
possible.
